## Conda environment
From the general python package sanity perspective, it is a good idea to use conda environments to make sure packages from different projects do not interfere with each other.


To create a conda env with python3, one runs 
```bash
conda create -n test python=3.6
```
To activate the env: 
```
conda activate test
```

### MuJoCo
Some of the baselines examples use [MuJoCo](http://www.mujoco.org) (multi-joint dynamics in contact) physics simulator, which is proprietary and requires binaries and a license (temporary 30-day license can be obtained from [www.mujoco.org](http://www.mujoco.org)). Instructions on setting up MuJoCo can be found [here](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py)

# Installation Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RLControlTheoreticGuarantee/Guarantee_Learning_Control
pip install numpy==1.16.3
pip install tensorflow==1.13.1
pip install tensorflow-probability==0.6.0
pip install opencv-python
pip install cloudpickle
pip install gym
pip install gym[atari]
pip3 install -U 'mujoco-py==1.50.1.68'
pip install matplotlib

```

### Example 1. LPPO with Atari Pong
For instance, to train a CNN network controlling Atari Pong using LPPO for 20M timesteps
```bash
python run.py
```

The hyperparameters, the tasks and the learning algorithm can be changed via change the run.py, for example:



The alg could be one of ['ppo2_lyapunov','ppo2','sppo']



The env could be one of ['PongNoFrameskip-v5','HalfCheetahcons-v0','Pointcircle-v0','Antcons-v0']



The info could control the training setting.
```bash
alg = 'ppo2_lyapunov'
additional_description ='-test' 
env = 'PongNoFrameskip-v5'
log_path = './log/' + env + '/' + alg + additional_description + '/' + str(i)
info = ['--num_timesteps=2e7', '--save_path=./Model/'+env]
```

And all the hyperparameters could be changed via change the defaults.py in every algorithms' file.
### Example 2. LSAC with continous cartpole
```
python main_for_sac.py
```
The hyperparameters, the tasks and the learning algorithm can be changed via change the variant.py, for example:



The env_name could be one of ['CartPolecons-v0','CartPolecost-v0','Antcons-v0', 'HalfCheetahcons-v0','Pointcircle-v0','Quadrotorcons-v0','Quadrotorcost-v0','FetchReach-v1', 'Carcost-v0']




The algorithm_name could be one of ['SAC_lyapunov', 'SAC', 'SSAC','CPO', 'CPO_lyapunov', 'PDO', 'DDPG','LAC','SAC_cost']



Other hyperparameter are also ajustable in variant.py.
```bash
VARIANT = {
    'env_name': 'CartPolecons-v0',
    'algorithm_name': 'SAC_lyapunov',
    'additional_description': '-Test',
    'evaluate': False,
    'train':True,
    'evaluation_frequency': 2048,
    'num_of_paths': 1,
    'num_of_trials': 5,
    'store_last_n_paths': 10,
    'start_of_trial': 0,
}
```
### Example 3. SAC/LAC cartpole stability against perturbations
When you get the trained policy, you could run ``` python main_for_sac.py ``` with this variant.
 
```bash
VARIANT = {
    'env_name': 'CartPolecost-v0',
    'algorithm_name': 'LAC',
    # 'algorithm_name': 'SAC_cost',
    'additional_description': '-value-perturb',
    'evaluate': False,
    'train':False,
    'evaluation_frequency': 2048,
    'num_of_paths': 1,
    'num_of_trials': 500,
    'store_last_n_paths': 10,
    'start_of_trial': 0,
}
```
